# Draw-A-Sketch
Retro themed drawing pad

## Idea
I had the idea to create this one night in bed and by the next day I had it working. I sent it 
to some friends and family for feedback. One point which was adding a move cursor option was super
fun to figure out. The next morning, I reworked it keeping their suggestions in mind. The final 
product isn't great, but the experience of working on it absolutely was.

## Instructions
To draw select a color and paint brush size. Then use the arrow keys to move around. There are 
also the abilities to move the cursor and erase paint. Simply select these actions and move 
with the arrow keys.
