I had the idea to create this one night in bed and by the next day I had it working. I sent it 
to some friends and family for feedback. One point which was adding a move cursor option was super
fun to figure out. The next morning, I reworked it keeping their suggestions in mind. The final 
product isn't great, but the experience of working on it absolutely was.
